# Permafrost-Fed Lakes in North America - Data Science Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on studying lakes in North America, with a particular emphasis on permafrost-fed lakes. Permafrost refers to a permanently frozen layer beneath the Earth's surface, composed of soil, gravel, and sand, typically bound together by ice.

While natural fluctuations in lake size and number are common, decadal-scale studies indicate that climate change is pushing these dynamic systems across a hydrological threshold. This shift results in either landscape-scale wetting (lake formation or expansion) or drying (lake drainage, desiccation, or infilling).

In this data science project, I practice **data visualization** skills while studying important climate-related topics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **[Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Extent Dataset (GLRSED)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aMyGb9QvuZZMzi5MM3Z2dk6RxpNblkEB/view?usp=sharing)**, which integrates data from:
- **HydroLAKES**
- **GRanD**
- **OpenStreetMap**

## Goals
- Explore and analyze the impact of climate change on North American lakes, especially permafrost-fed lakes.
- Visualize lake formation, expansion, drainage, and desiccation trends over time.

# Note
This project is from the **[NSDC](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc-dsp-permafrost-lakes/)** and was solely completed by Lisa Mills.
